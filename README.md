# electrophysiology-SQLdatabase-interaction-with-Python
This repository serves to interact with a SQLdatabase using Python.
The current codes serve to create tables containing the analyses from:
* the electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampus (LFP) and the entorhinal cortex (patch-clamped neurons) 
* the biocytin and immunohistochemical stainings from the recorded neurons
Soon more codes will be added to query the tables.
