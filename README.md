# SQL-database-interaction-with-Python
This repository serves to interact with a SQLdatabase using Python.
The current codes serve to:
*  create the tables containing the analyses from the electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampus (LFP) and the entorhinal cortex (patch-clamped neurons) and the biocytin and immunohistochemical stainings from the recorded neurons.
*  query the tables.
